# Scaffold for reactive project on Java

This is a project intended to give a code base on witch developers could start a reactive REST API.

The project makes use of:

* [Clean Archtecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
For building the system archtecture
* Solid
For guide the development based on Robert C Martin [Design Principles and Design Patterns](https://web.archive.org/web/20150906155800/http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/Principles_and_Patterns.pdf)
* [Spring-boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
For supporting the Dependency-Inversion Solid principle, start the embedded reactive server [Netty](https://netty.io) and manage the configurations of the project
